/*
Distinct occurrences
Given two strings S and T, find count of distinct occurrences of T in S as a sub-sequence. Your task is to complete the function subsequenceCount which takes two strings as argument S and T and returns the count of the sub-sequences.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer t denoting the no of test cases . Then t test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains 2 strings S and T.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the count of distinct occurrences of T in S as a sub-sequence.

Constraints:
1<=t<=100
1<=length of (S,T)<=100

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input
2
banana ban
geeksforgeeks ge

Output
3
6

Explanation:
(i) For first test case  S = banana, T = ban there are 3 sub-sequences which are [ban], [ba n], [b an].
(ii) For second test case S = geeksforgeeks, T=ge there are 6 sub-sequences which are  [ge], [ ge], [g e], [g e] [g e] and [ g e].
